# Magic-Glove
This is a project we developed for a MLH hackathon. It is a glove with a raspberry pi camera in the palm. The raspberry pi uses this too read text and then reads it out through some headphones that the user can be wearing. We hope that this project could help people with issues reading access more opportunities and become more independent.
